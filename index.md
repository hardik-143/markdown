# What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is widely used for formatting plain text documents.

It was created with the goal of allowing people to write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format that could be converted into HTML.

Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.
