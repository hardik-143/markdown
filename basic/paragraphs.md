# Paragraphs


To add a paragraph to your markdown file, you just need to use a blank line between the sentences. For example:

```markdown
This is a paragraph. It is a block of text. It is separated from the next paragraph by a blank line.
This is another paragraph. It is also a block of text. It is also separated from the previous paragraph by a blank line.
```


will render as:

```markdown
<p>This is a paragraph. It is a block of text. It is separated from the next paragraph by a blank line.</p>
```
    
```markdown
<p>This is another paragraph. It is also a block of text. It is also separated from the previous paragraph by a blank line.</p>
```
