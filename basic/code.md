# Code

To add code to your markdown file, you can use backticks. For example:

```
This is a code block.
```

will render as:

```markdown
<pre><code>This is a code block.</code></pre>
```

You can also add code inline by using single backticks. For example:

This is `inline code`.


will render as:

```markdown
<p>This is <code>inline code</code>.</p>
```
